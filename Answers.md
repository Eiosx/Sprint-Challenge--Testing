1. In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

describe() is used to create a scope that contains related tests. it() is a method used to run tests to check for expected outcomes.

2. What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

The point of TTD is to optimize coding workflow, squash software bugs faster, reduce regressions, etc. I believe TTD is worth it despite it's initial time investment.

3. Mention three types of automated tests.
unit tests, integration tests, and ui tests
